#Sniper Game
A simple arcade-style sniper game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a sniper who shoots bullets at falling enemies while avoiding letting them reach the bottom of the screen. The game features sound effects, dynamic difficulty, and a lives system.

#Features
Player Movement: Control the sniper using the left and right arrow keys.
Shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at enemies.
Enemies: Red rectangles fall from the top of the screen, and the player must shoot them before they reach the bottom.
Lives System: The player starts with 3 lives. Missing enemies reduces lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
